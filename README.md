Hi.

It is a bot that scans twitter for specific words. Then it creates a JSON file with tweet and user data, and finally dynamically displays the content in the index.html file. The update takes place every 5 seconds.

NPM packages:
-twit
-fs

Of course you also need React and Twitter developer account with access to API.

Please, enjoy.
